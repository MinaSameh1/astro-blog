      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Mina</strong> and I'm a <strong
          >backend developer</strong
        > from Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a simple <strong>astro</strong> blog I made for fun and to share
        my thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mostly write about Nodejs, Typescript, and other backend related
        stuff. Sometimes I also write about React and other frontend stuff.
