<p>
I have been taking an <abbr title="High Performance Computing">HPC</abbr> course during my master's, so why not write about it?
I will talk about what is High Performance Computing and its use cases
</p>

<h2>
Introduction to HPC
</h2>
In the past microprocessors were speeding in the increase of performance,
increasing an average of 50% per year, In the past years it dropped to 20% increase per yea

That isn't necessary a bad thing, because we have found other ways to increase
performance, Instead of designing and building faster microprocessors we put
_multiple_ processors on a single integrated circuit.

<h5>
But why we need increasing performance?
</h5>
To solve problems, problems such as:

- Decoding the human genome
- Fast and accurate web searches
- More realistic Games
- To automate more jobs (Feels like AI will replace us all soon)

And more complex problems that are still waiting for a solution, take for
example _**climate modeling**_, the study of _**complex molecules**_, _**drug discovery**_
and _**Energy Research**_.
I will talk briefly about _climate modeling_.

<h4>
Climate Modeling
</h4>

In the interest of better _understand_ climate change, we need far more accurate computer
models, to _gather_ and _understand_ data about interactions between atmosphere,
the oceans, solid land, and the ice caps at the poles. To make detailed studies
of how varied interventions might affect the global climate.
