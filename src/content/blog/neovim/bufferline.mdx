If you are a vim or neovim user, you might have come across the concept of a "<a href="https://github.com/akinsho/bufferline.nvim">bufferline</a>".
A bufferline is a visual representation of open buffers (files) in your editor,
typically displayed at the top of the window.
It allows you to quickly switch between different files and manage your workspace more efficiently.

Most poeple have their own preferences when it comes to bufferlines. But I did notice a lot of people hate it or outright reject using it and saying to use the
built in navigation commands.

I do use the built in commands, but I would like to have a visual representation of my open files. I do not move the mouse and click on them but sometimes I do like knowing what I have open to close or switch to.
Of course one can use the `:ls` or fzf buffer picker, but I still like to see them at the top.

Its just preferences and depends on the workflow, but I do agree with concerns about screen space, clutter and mouse usage! But I do think that a well designed bufferline can be a useful tool for managing open buffers in vim/neovim.
